1. You can relate with this, the only part I have to guide you is that, *you pay attention to what the question asks you to do.* It can either tell you to **choose the correct answer** or **choose all correct answers**. In the former case, you can only select a single answer, while in the latter you can select multiple answers.

> Final Words:\
I developed this App with the developer community in mind, it came from the idea that, what if as we learn day-by-day, we set quizzes from what we've learnt and share it to others, and also gain from others by solving their own quizzes too. And so I decided to create this. **We own this App together**, I'm just opportuned to be the creator, so lets nuture this baby together. I believe this App will solve some problems posed to the developer community, MOST ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINNERS.\
The highest good remark you could give to me or this App is:
> * Spreading the news about the App.
> * Contibuting to the App: Adding Questions, Fixing Bugs and more...

*I love you, I love the DEV Community. Thanks!*
